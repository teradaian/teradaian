- Hi, Iâ€™m Ian Terada! ðŸ‘‹


- :brain: Iâ€™m interested in 
developing experience with projects through open-source collaboration. That's why we're all here right? Learning from a bunch of wicked smart people and hopefully giving back as much as we can.



- :thinking: Iâ€™m currently studying React, Redux, Javascript(forever), and delving deeper into Python, HTML, and CSS.

  I'm fascinated by the Why's of programming, and the endless innumerations and improvements that go into these living languages.
